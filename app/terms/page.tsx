      <h2>
        <span className="num">01</span>Acceptance of terms
      </h2>
      <p>
        By creating a ThreadLens account or connecting a Threads account to ThreadLens, you agree to these Terms of
        Service (&ldquo;Terms&rdquo;). If you do not agree, do not use the service. ThreadLens is operated by{" "}
        <b>Indo Berkah Solution</b>, Jakarta, Indonesia (&ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo;).
      </p>

      <h2>
        <span className="num">02</span>The service
      </h2>
      <p>
        ThreadLens is an analytics dashboard for personal and business Threads accounts. We retrieve data through
        Meta&apos;s official Threads Graph API, present it as charts and tables, and generate AI-assisted summaries of
        your content&apos;s performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        The service is <b>read-only</b>. ThreadLens does not post, reply, message, follow, like, repost, or perform any
        other interaction on your behalf.
      </p>

      <h2>
        <span className="num">03</span>Eligibility &amp; accounts
      </h2>
      <ul>

        <li>You are responsible for keeping your login credentials confidential and for activity under your account.</li>
        <li>You must provide accurate information when registering and keep it up to date.</li>
        <li>
          One ThreadLens account per person. You may connect multiple Threads accounts you legitimately own or manage.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>
        <span className="num">04</span>Connecting Threads &amp; use of Meta&apos;s API
      </h2>
      <p>
        You connect a Threads account by signing in through Meta&apos;s official OAuth flow. You authorize ThreadLens to
        read your posts and insights via the Threads Graph API. We never see, request, or store your Threads or
        Instagram password.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your use of Threads remains governed by Meta&apos;s terms. We comply with the Threads API terms and the Meta
        Platform Terms; if our use ever conflicts with those, Meta&apos;s terms control with respect to the data
        accessed through their API.
      </p>

      <h2>

        <span className="num">06</span>AI-assisted analysis
      </h2>
      <p>
        ThreadLens uses third-party large language models (via OpenRouter) to generate performance summaries and
        recommendations. Output is provided as informational guidance, not as professional advice. We do not guarantee
        that recommendations will improve account performance.

      <p>
        When you trigger an analysis, post content (text and metrics) is sent to the LLM provider for processing. See
        our <Link href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</Link> for details.
